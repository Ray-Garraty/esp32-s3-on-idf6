# Protocol: Stack Overflow

## Trigger
- `***ERROR*** A stack overflow in task <name> has been detected.`
- Guru Meditation LoadProhibited with corrupted/truncated backtrace
- Guru Meditation with `EXCVADDR = 0xFFFFFFA0` or similar NULL+offset pattern
- Intermittent crashes that change address on every boot
- Crash that disappears when logging is reduced or removed
- Boot crash where stack watermark is < 2048 bytes (see S1)

## Default Stack Sizes

| Task | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `main` (main task) | 16384 (16 KB) | Config: `CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE` |
| Motor thread | 8192 (8 KB) | `MOTOR_THREAD_STACK` in `src/config.rs` |
| Temperature thread | 4096 (4 KB) | `std::thread::spawn()` |
| UART reader | 4096 (4 KB) | `std::thread::spawn()` / `mpsc` |
| Net owner thread | 8192 (8 KB) | Custom spawn |

## Steps

### Step 1: Diagnose Which Task Overflows

**If explicit FreeRTOS detection message is present:**
```
***ERROR*** A stack overflow in task main has been detected.
```
→ The crashing task is named in the message. Fix: increase its stack size.

**If no explicit message — check watermark for ALL tasks:**
```rust
// [INVESTIGATION] check all task watermarks
log::info!("main stack watermark: {}",
    ecotiter_fw::esp_safe::stack_watermark());
```

### Step 2: Check Backtrace for Corruption

A corrupted backtrace is the #1 sign of stack overflow:
```
Backtrace: 0x403....:0x3ffd....
```
versus a healthy backtrace:
```
Backtrace:
  0x403....:0x3ffd....
  0x403....:0x3ffd....
  0x403....:0x3ffd....
```

If backtrace has only 1–2 entries when it should have 10+ → stack pointer
has been corrupted by overflow.

### Step 3: Measure Stack Usage

1. Add watermark measurement to the crashing task at every key point.
2. Calculate: `used_bytes = stack_size - watermark`
3. If used > 80% of stack size → overflow likely under load.

### Step 4: Increase Stack Size

Find the relevant config and double it:

| Location | Variable | Default | Action |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| `sdkconfig.defaults` | `CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE` | 16384 | Increase by 2x |
| `src/config.rs` | `MOTOR_THREAD_STACK` | 8192 | Increase by 2x |
| `std::thread::spawn()` | 3rd arg | 4096 | Increase via `Builder::stack_size()` |

After doubling → build → flash → test.

### Step 5: Find Minimum Viable Stack

If doubling fixes the crash, binary-search the minimum required size:
1. Set to midpoint between old and new value.
2. Build → flash → test.
3. If OK, reduce further. If crash, increase.
4. When done, add 20% safety margin.

### Step 6: Root Cause — Why Did Stack Usage Grow?

Once the crash is fixed, identify the code change that pushed stack usage
over the limit:

- New deep call chains (function A → B → C → D → E)
- New large stack allocations (`[T; N]` locals, `Vec` with inline capacity)
- New thread spawns (each thread has its own stack)
- New `log::info!()` calls (log buffer on stack)
- Recursive or deeply nested parser/handler
- New `heapless::Vec<_, N>` with large `N` on the stack

## ESP32 Stack Overflow Mechanics

On ESP32, the stack grows DOWNWARD from high addresses. The stack canary
is placed at the top of the stack (lowest address). When stack overflows:

1. **First stage:** Canary is overwritten → FreeRTOS detects on next context
   switch → `***ERROR*** A stack overflow in task ...` message.
2. **Second stage** (no canary / canary disabled): Stack writes into adjacent
   memory. Adjacent to the main task stack is typically the TLSF heap metadata.
   This produces a misleading heap corruption Guru Meditation.
3. **Third stage** (severe overflow): Stack corrupts FreeRTOS TCB or other
   kernel structures → unpredictable crash.

This is why **S1 (stack watermark) must run before S2 (heap integrity)**.
A "heap corruption" crash at boot is a stack overflow until proven otherwise.
