# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Rules (ESP32-S3 + C++23 + ESP-IDF v6)

Agent-critical rules for this firmware. Reference details in `docs/refs/project.md`
(hardware, threads, network) and `docs/refs/coding_style.md` (C++23 conventions,
RAII, error handling). Violations of CRITICAL rules invalidate all changes.

- **Path accuracy**: File paths in sub-agent prompts must be relative to the repo root (e.g. `legacy/arduino/src/`, not `arduino/src/` or `src/`). The sub-agent's working directory is the workspace root — relative paths in prompts are resolved from there.

- **Legacy dir in .gitignore — DO NOT USE Glob for legacy/**: The `legacy/` directory is gitignored, so Glob (`**/*.h`, `**/stepper*`) does NOT find files there. Always use absolute or repo-relative paths with `Read` or `Grep` (rg) for legacy files. See §Legacy Path References below for exact paths.

- **Hybrid monitoring**: CI/automation uses `scripts/monitor.py` (custom — ResultCode, BootDetector, DedupTracker). Interactive debugging uses `idf.py monitor` / `scripts/idf.sh monitor` (auto addr2line, GDBStub, print-filter). Post-mortem → `crash_analyzer.py` + optionally `espcoredump.py`.

## 1. CRITICAL RULES (Auto-Revert)

### GR-0: PLATINUM RULE — VERIFY EVERYTHING YOU WROTE

Before ANY commit, BEFORE declaring any task done, and BEFORE calling any
other agent or tool — verify everything you produced:

- **Code**: syntax check, **build**, test, lint. Never assume it works.
- **Scripts**: `bash -n` for shell, `compile()` for Python, etc.
- **Runtime**: if changes touch firmware or scripts that run on hardware,
  MUST call `scripts/idf.sh build` (firmware) and/or run the Python script
  on real hardware. Syntax-only verification is INSUFFICIENT.
- **Changes**: `git diff` to confirm only intended changes.
- **Logic**: trace edge cases in your head before claiming correctness.
- **Agent output**: if another agent made changes, review them before accepting.
  Rebuild and re-test the modified components.

If you cannot verify (no toolchain, no hardware), say so explicitly.
Silence = trusted. Only trusted code ships.

Failure (2026-07-12): Sub-agents repeatedly committed code that didn't
compile, left stale locks, and skipped syntax checks. Every issue was
caught by manual re-verification — 100% avoidable.

### GR-1: NEVER BLOCK THE MAIN LOOP

Main loop (FreeRTOS task `main`) must NEVER execute a blocking operation.
Calls that block > 10 ms MUST live in a dedicated thread.

**Forbidden:** `rmt_tx_wait_all_done()`, `vTaskDelay()` > 10 ms,
`xQueueReceive(portMAX_DELAY)`, `std::mutex::lock()`, synchronous I/O.

**Allowed:** `std::atomic` load/store/fetch, `std::mutex::try_lock()` with
false handling, poll/process functions, `vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(10))`,
non-blocking FD writes.

Failure (2026-07-03): Homing called `rmt_tx_wait_all_done()` in main,
blocking for 11 s. WiFi/BLE init never ran.

### GR-2: MANDATORY RMT STOP FLAGS

Every RMT motion function MUST accept a `std::atomic<bool>*` stop flag
and check it between chunks. If set — abort immediately.

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] std::expected<void, StepperError> move_steps_intervals(
    std::span<const uint32_t> intervals,
    std::atomic<bool>* stop_flag = nullptr
) {
    for (auto chunk : split_into_chunks(intervals, CHUNK_SIZE)) {
        if (stop_flag && stop_flag->load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
            std::ignore = emergency_stop();
            return std::unexpected(StepperError::LimitSwitchTriggered);
        }
        auto result = rmt_transmit_wait(chunk);
        if (!result) return std::unexpected(result.error());
    }
    return {};
}
```

Failure (2026-07-03): Homing omitted stop flag. Motor ran through FULL limit switch.

### GR-3: DRAM INIT ORDER (The Triangle)

Three-way DRAM conflict. Order MUST be: WiFi → HTTP → BLE.

1. WiFi driver init (~3.5 KB DRAM)
2. `wifi.startAP()` — AP mode on 192.168.4.1/24
3. `wifi.tryStartSTA()` — async STA connect (non-blocking)
4. HTTP server bind to 0.0.0.0:80 (12 KB contiguous MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL)
5. BLE NimBLE init (12 KB contiguous MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL)
6. `ensureGpioReady()` — wait for PHY calibration (LL-031)

```cpp
auto result = wifi_.init();
if (!result) return std::unexpected(result.error());
wifi_.startAP();
wifi_.tryStartSTA();          // non-blocking — async connect
http_server_ = HttpServer::create();
if (!http_server_) return std::unexpected(http_server_.error());
result = ble_.init();
if (!result) return std::unexpected(result.error());
```

Note: After BLE init, `ensureGpioReady()` calls `esp_phy_deinit()` + `esp_phy_init()` to prevent PHY calibration spinlock deadlock (LL-031).

Failures (2026-07-01): Each reordering (HTTP→BLE→WiFi, BLE→WiFi→HTTP,
WiFi→BLE→HTTP) fixed one issue but broke another.

### GR-4: COEXISTENCE POLICY — NEVER PREFER BT

Forbidden: `esp_coex_preference_set(ESP_COEX_PREFER_BT)`.
Use default `ESP_COEX_PREFER_BALANCE`.

Failure (2026-07-01): `ESP_COEX_PREFER_BT` starved WiFi L2 — STA got IP but
100 % TCP packet loss.

### GR-5: NO RAW ESP-IDF POINTERS ACROSS TASK BOUNDARIES

Forbidden: Storing `httpd_req_t*`, `httpd_ws_frame_t*`, or any ESP-IDF opaque
pointer in `std::shared_ptr` / `std::atomic<T*>` / across threads. ESP-IDF
frees the struct when the C handler returns.

Required: WebSocket API (`httpd_ws_send_frame_async`) or copy data into
`std::array<char, N>` before leaving the C callback.

Failure (2026-07-02): SSE stored `std::shared_ptr<std::atomic<httpd_req_t*>>`
in main loop. Crash with EXCVADDR=0x28.

### GR-6: STACK BUDGET IS LAW

Every task MUST specify stack size from the budget table in `docs/refs/project.md`.
No exceptions. No defaults.

Forbidden in threads with stack ≤ 8 KB:
- `std::format()` / `std::print()` in loops
- `nlohmann::json::dump()` without pre-allocated buffer
- Large stack-local arrays (`uint8_t buf[4096]`)
- Deep recursion

Mandatory: After moving code between threads, verify with
`uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark()` or log watermark before/after.

Failure (2026-07-03): Moving homing to 8 KB motor task caused stack overflow.
Increased to 16 KB (see budget table).

### GR-7: MANDATORY DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTATION

Every new function MUST have:

| What | Instrumentation |
|------|----------------|
| FFI boundary | `FfiGuard guard(boundary_id)` RAII wrapper |
| RMT motion | `assert_rmt_preconditions()` before `move_steps_intervals()` |
| New thread | `StackMonitor::register_thread(name, stack_size)` |
| State transition | `StateTracer::log_burette_transition(old, new)` |
| Large alloc (>4 KB) | `HeapSnapshot::assert_can_allocate(size)` |
| Main loop body | `TickWatchdog watchdog` RAII wrapper |

Code without these instrumentation points is INCOMPLETE.
Rationale: Every past crash was detectible pre-mortem by a diagnostic event.

---

### GR-10: ONLY THE USER ASSESSES PHYSICAL STATE

The AI agent MUST NEVER make claims about physical-world observations
(LED color, motor movement, relay clicks, limit swithes being pressed, device
visibility on mobile phone scanners, or any other observable phenomenon). Only the
user can see, hear, or otherwise perceive hardware behavior.

**Forbidden:**
- "LED turned green"
- "Motor moved successfully"
- "The limit switch has been pressed", etc.

**Required:**
- Present raw data (serial logs, script output, terminal text)
- Ask the user what they observe via the `question` tool
- Record the user's exact words as evidence
- Use user-reported observations as ground truth

Failure (2026-07-08): Agent claimed "LED turned green ✅" based on serial
log interpretation. The physical LED had not yet changed because the fix
wasn't fully applied.

---

### GR-11: MANDATORY ESP-IDF MASTER + LEGACY STUDY BEFORE CODEGEN

Before ANY code generation touching WiFi, DNS, HTTP, BLE, RMT, or any
ESP-IDF API call, study the local authoritative copies:

**Primary — `<device root>/home/vlabe/Downloads/esp-idf-master`:**
The authoritative header source for ESP-IDF v6 (dev branch). Verify function
signatures, struct definitions, enum values, and header locations here.
Online docs may be out of date or mismatch the local build.

**Secondary — `<repository root>/legacy/arduino`:**
Legacy Arduino-based firmware — **SOURCE OF BUSINESS LOGIC ONLY** (dosing
algorithms and math, calibration formulas, WebUI etc). Study when porting algorithms
or maintaining compatibility with existing protocol expectations. Do NOT copy
Arduino syntax (digitalWrite, Serial.println, etc.) into ESP-IDF code.

Required: grep/read the relevant headers in BOTH directories BEFORE writing
any code that calls espressif APIs or replicates Arduino behaviour or business logic.

Failure (2026-07-09): Agent wrote `ESP_NETIF_DOMAIN_NAME_SERVER` with wrong
param type (`uint32_t*`). A 30-second grep of esp-idf-master headers would
have shown the actual API expects `uint8_t`.

### GR-12: MANDATORY DUAL-CORE MODE — NEVER DISABLE SECOND CORE

ESP32-S3 is a dual-core chip. `CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` MUST be `n` in
`sdkconfig.defaults`. Single-core mode causes deterministic spinlock deadlocks
when WiFi or BLE are enabled (LL-045) — the WiFi driver and WiFi ISR compete
for the same spinlock on the same core, freezing the tick interrupt and
triggering RWDT reset.

**Required:** `CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE=n` (dual-core mode).

**Forbidden:** `CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE=y` in any committed configuration.

**Exception:** The `debugger` sub-agent MAY temporarily set `=y` for
isolation experiments (e.g. to reproduce or rule out a UNICORE-specific bug).
In that case, the debugger MUST restore `=n` before reporting done. Any
other sub-agent or human committing `=y` will be reverted automatically.

Failure (2026-07-12): `CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE=y` caused RTCWDT_SYS_RST
boot loops on WiFi AP start. 3 debugger sessions and ~3 hours wasted before
the root cause was identified.

### GR-13: SUB-AGENT MUST STOP AND ESCALATE AFTER 3 FAILED ITERATIONS

Sub-agents executing tasks autonomously MUST follow this protocol:

1. **Escalation threshold**: After 3 consecutive failed attempts at any
   subtask (e.g., a build fails, a tool returns unexpected results, an
   investigation finds no answer), STOP. Report to orchestrator with:
   - What was tried
   - What was found so far
   - What help is needed to proceed

2. **No scope creep**: NEVER fix a discovered problem without asking first.
   Report the finding, propose a fix, wait for authorisation. Deviating
   from the task spec without approval invalidates all changes.

3. **Static analysis before full builds**: If investigating a build issue
   requires more than 2 full builds, switch to static analysis (compare
   build.ninja, check generated files, verify compiler flags in the log).

4. **Stay on task**: After every 10 tool calls, check: "am I still working
   on the original goal?" If not — realign or escalate.

5. **Time budget**: If a single investigation exceeds 15 minutes without
   producing actionable output, stop and escalate.

```yaml
# Violation example (LL-046):
# Task: measure build times + add timing to script.
# Agent ran 13 full builds (~40 min of waiting), discovered the root cause
# (BUILD_DATE poisons ccache), started refactoring CMakeLists.txt without
# asking, and delivered zero output. 5596-line session log, 0 useful results.
```

Failure (2026-07-12): Sub-agent ses_0a9c received a well-scoped task but
ran 13 full builds, 100+ tool calls, and 0 useful output. Session log:
.opencode/tmp/session-ses_0a9c.md (5596 lines). See LL-046 for full analysis.

---

## 2. PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST (Copy Before Codegen)

Before generating code touching: threads, network, RMT, FFI, mutexes, queues,
GPIO ISR, NVS, WiFi, BLE, or HTTP — copy and fill:

1. **Thread:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Main/Motor/Temp/BLE/HTTP/net_owner)
2. **Blocking >10 ms?** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Yes → move to worker: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)
3. **Stack impact:** format/string/arrays/recursion? \_\_\_\_ Budget: \_\_\_\_ KB
4. **Init order dep:** WiFi IP / HTTP / BLE / none? \_\_\_\_
5. **FFI boundary:** Stores C pointers? \_\_\_\_ Copies before return? \_\_\_\_
6. **Stop flag:** RMT/motion? \_\_\_\_ (if yes: GR-2 REQUIRED)
7. **DRAM:** MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL? \_\_\_\_ Position in init order? \_\_\_\_

---

## 3. EMBEDDED HARDWARE INVARIANTS

### 3.1 GPIO Pinout

⚠️ **CRITICAL: PSRAM/Flash bus pins (26-37) are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN for gpio_set_direction/gpio_config.**
See `docs/refs/unsafe_gpio_pins.md` for full list, explanations, and safe alternatives.

Note: Status LED is GPIO48 (RGB WS2812 via RMT), not GPIO2. The `RgbLed` class drives it using WS2812 protocol through an RMT TX channel. Active HIGH `gpio_set_level` is NOT used.

| GPIO | Function | Constraint |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | U0TXD | Serial — DO NOT TOUCH |
| 3 | U0RXD | Serial — DO NOT TOUCH |
| 48 | Status LED (RGB WS2812) | RMT TX channel — WS2812 protocol |
| 4 | ADC (pH electrode) | `adc_oneshot_read()` (ADC1_CH3) — 0-2900 mV |
| 14 | Valve | `gpio_set_level()` — LOW=input, HIGH=output |
| 21 | TMC2209 STEP | `rmt_new_tx_channel()` — pulse train |
| 5 | TMC2209 DIR | `gpio_set_level()` — HIGH=CW (moved from GPIO26: LL-027 PSRAM CS1) |
| 27 | TMC2209 EN | `gpio_set_level()` — Active LOW; **gpio_set_direction will hang** (PSRAM data bus) |
| 7 | Endstop FULL | GPIO ISR pos-edge → `std::atomic<bool>` (NOT GPIO34 — PSRAM D5, LL-027) |
| 6 | DS18B20 | OneWire bitbang — 4.7k pull-up (NOT GPIO33 — PSRAM D4, LL-027) |
| 15 | Endstop HOME | GPIO ISR pos-edge → `std::atomic<bool>` (syringe top, homing reference; NOT GPIO35 — PSRAM D6, LL-027) |

### 3.2 RMT

`rmt_tx_wait_all_done()` in **motor thread only** — never in main loop.
EN pin active LOW: `gpio_set_level(en, 0)` in constructor.

### 3.3 Peripheral Drivers

| Driver | File |
|--------|------|
| TMC2209 | infrastructure/drivers/stepper.cpp |
| Endstops | infrastructure/drivers/limitswitch.cpp |
| DS18B20 | infrastructure/drivers/onewire.cpp |
| NVS | infrastructure/storage/nvs.cpp |

---

## 4. BUILD & CI

### 4.1 Commands

| Command | Purpose | Timeout |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `scripts/idf.sh build` | Build firmware (clean build, auto‑removes `sdkconfig`) | ≥ 120 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh flash` | Flash firmware (auto‑detect port) | ≥ 60 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh monitor` | Serial monitor (live log, auto‑detect port) | 30 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh smoke` | Automated smoke test (build + flash + 30s monitor) | 120 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh uart` | UART command test | 60 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh reconfigure` | Remove `sdkconfig` + `idf.py reconfigure` | ≥ 60 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh test` | Host unit tests (Catch2) | 60 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh tidy` | clang-tidy | 60 s |
| `scripts/idf.sh clean` | Remove build dirs | 15 s |

### 4.2 Build Script Mandatory

**NEVER call `idf.py` directly.** Always use `scripts/idf.sh` — it wraps
ESP-IDF environment setup and provides consistent error handling.

### 4.3 sdkconfig Policy

Edit only `sdkconfig.defaults` — never `sdkconfig` (auto-generated).
Never run `idf.py menuconfig`.

**`scripts/idf.sh build` always does a clean build (removes `build/` + `sdkconfig`)** — this
forces CMake to regenerate from `sdkconfig.defaults`, exposing config
mismatches that a stale file would silently hide.

After changing `sdkconfig.defaults`, also available:
`scripts/idf.sh reconfigure` (remove + `idf.py reconfigure` without full
build).

Key defaults: `CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE=32768`,
`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_INIT=y`, `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S=10`,
`CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_HOST_TASK_STACK_SIZE=12288`,
`CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ=1000`, `CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE=n`,
`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM=6`.
**Constraint:** `WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM` MUST be ≥ `WIFI_RX_BA_WIN`
(see Known Patterns §5).

### 4.4 Partitions & Dependencies

Partition table in `partitions.csv` — do not change without approval.
Component deps via CMake: `main`, `nlohmann_json`, `catch2`.

### 4.5 ccache Build Acceleration

- **ccache** used automatically (`IDF_CCACHE_ENABLE=1`). Clean builds after the
  first one take 1–2 min instead of 5–10. To verify: `ccache -s | grep "Hits:"`.
  Stats printed at end of every build.

---

## 5. CRASH INVESTIGATION

Any ESP32 crash is a RED ALERT. The diagnostic subsystem
(`components/diag/`) intercepts ALL crashes via `__wrap_esp_panic_handler`.

### Crash Output Format

```
=== CRASH ===
exccause=0 name=IllegalInstruction pc=0x40091100 ...
=== REGISTERS ===
a0=0x800910c8 ...
=== BACKTRACE ===
0x400910fd:0x3fffcee0 ...
=== BLACK BOX (64 events, newest first) ===
[822us] t4 FfiExit { boundary: 20, result: 0 }
=== STACK ===
t0 main watermark=0  t1 motor watermark=0 ...
```

### Triage Pipeline

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Serial log exists | `python3 scripts/crash_analyzer.py < crash.txt` |
| Live capture | `timeout 60 python3 scripts/monitor.py` |
| Raw crash text | `python3 scripts/crash_analyzer.py < crash.txt` |

### Known Patterns (from docs/lessons_learned/)

| Signature | Real Cause | Fix |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| A2=0xFFFFFFFC, tlsf_check, heap_caps_*free | Stack overflow, NOT heap (LL-001) | Increase stack, check watermark FIRST |
| ESP_ERR_HTTPD_TASK (45064) | DRAM fragmentation | GR-3 init order; move BLE to net_owner |
| wifi:fail to alloc timer, type=9 | WiFi timer after BLE+HTTP ate DRAM | Reduce WiFi buffer counts |
| StoreProhibited EXCVADDR=0x28 | Dangling httpd_req_t (GR-5) | WebSocket API; no stored C pointers |
| IllegalInstruction + heap 6 KB largest | DRAM fragment → HTTP alloc fail (LL-004) | Keep event loop handle alive |
| GPIO init hangs on pins 26-37 | PSRAM/Flash bus conflict (LL-027) | Move GPIOs to safe pins (5,6,7,15) |
| `esp_phy_load` spinlock at boot | PHY calibration deadlock (LL-031) | Call `phy_deinit()` before BLE init, reinit after |
| `wifi_init.c:52` `#error "WIFI_RX_BA_WIN > WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM"` | Stale `sdkconfig` hid changed `sdkconfig.defaults` | `scripts/idf.sh build` auto‑removes stale build dir; also fix `WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM` in defaults |

---

## 6. SERIAL & PYTHON SAFETY

### 6.1 Serial Port Safety

- FORBIDDEN to launch background processes holding serial ports
- Any blocking/serial tool MUST have explicit `timeout <seconds>` prefix
- Never leave a process occupying ttyUSB/ttyACM after exit

```
# CORRECT
timeout 30 python3 scripts/monitor.py

# FORBIDDEN
python3 -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

### 6.2 Python Script Rules

- NEVER use `python -c "..."` inline — bash on Windows mangles quotes
- ALWAYS write Python to a temp file first, then run it
- Use `/tmp/opencode` for temp scripts

### 6.3 Log File Handling — NEVER READ FULL LOGS

Do NOT read full log files from `logs/` with the Read tool. A single 10 s
monitor session produces 3000+ lines, consuming excessive context tokens
and often overflowing the window.

**Additionally, `logs/serial_*.log` files contain binary null bytes (`\0`) from
the ESP32 ROM bootloader output. The Read tool rejects these as binary files.**
Always use `bash` with `tail`, `rg -a`, `strings`, or `crash_analyzer.py`
to inspect serial logs — never `Read`.

**Required instead:**
- **Crash analysis:** `python3 scripts/crash_analyzer.py < logs/serial_*.log`
- **Grep for specific patterns:** Use the Grep tool on `logs/` (e.g. `"Panic handler"`, `"exccause="`).
- **Tail last N lines:** `bash tail -n 50 logs/serial_*.log`
- **Search by keyword:** `bash rg "BOOT_OK\|CRASH\|exccause" logs/serial_*.log`

**Forbidden:**
- `Read` on any `logs/*.log` file without `limit=` and `offset=` to restrict
  to a specific window.
- Passing a full log file to the Read tool with no limit.
- `Read` on `logs/serial_*.log` at all (binary null bytes → Read rejects).

### 6.4 Monitor Verbosity — DEFAULT IS QUIET

`scripts/monitor.py` runs in **quiet mode by default**: serial lines go only to
the log file, not stdout. Only status messages (connection, result) appear
in the terminal.

**AI agent MUST NOT use `--verbose`.** The log file is the source of truth.
Analyse it via indirect tools (crash_analyzer, grep, rg, tail).

```bash
# CORRECT (agent)
timeout 30 python3 scripts/monitor.py
scripts/crash_analyzer.py < logs/serial_*.log
rg "BOOT_OK\|CRASH" logs/

# FORBIDDEN (agent)
python3 scripts/monitor.py --verbose
Read(logs/serial_*.log)       # no limit/offset
```

**Human debug session (separate terminal window):** `python3 scripts/monitor.py --verbose`

---

## 7. .opencode/ DIRECTORY RULES

### GR-8: GLOB TOOL RESTRICTION

The `Glob` tool does **not** work inside `.opencode/`. Use `Read` to list
and inspect files under `.opencode/`.

### GR-9: SUB-AGENT DOCUMENT CREATION RESTRICTION

Sub-agents are **forbidden** from creating `.md` or `.yaml` files inside
`.opencode/`. Exception: `.opencode/tmp/` — temporary files allowed.

**Violation → revert immediately.**

---
